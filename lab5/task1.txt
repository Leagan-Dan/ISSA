1. the client is the mobile app, meaning the owner or the renter, and the car.
The server is the producer backend.

------------

2. the renter client comunicates with the server (backend), and then 
the server comunicates with the owner client, in order to establish
the two user's comunication. this comunication works both ways, and
is used when the renter sends a rent request, and the owner receives it.


------------

3.the scope of the mobile app is to give the owner and the renter
an interface, in order to establish communication 

the scope of the server backend is to receive and send messages 
between mobile app clients(renter and owner) and to accept or 
decline rent requests, according to what the owner wants

the scope of the car is to unlock or lock whenever the 
server demands it, or to  send other information about itself.
